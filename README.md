# Proxy-Free QR-Based Attendance System

## 📌 Overview
Traditional attendance systems are inefficient, error-prone, and susceptible to fraud. Our solution eliminates proxy attendance and ensures accuracy using a **QR-based** system with **Bluetooth-based geo-fencing**. This system is designed to enhance academic integrity and student engagement by automating attendance tracking.

## 🚀 Features
- **QR-Based Attendance** – Unique QR codes generated by the lecturer for each lecture.
- **Geo-Fencing with Bluetooth** – Ensures attendance is marked only within a **10m radius** of the lecturer’s device.
- **Real-Time Integration** – Seamless connectivity with Learning Management Systems (LMS).
- **Secure & Scalable** – Implements encryption and is designed for institutions of all sizes.

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI  
- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Database:** MySQL with phpMyAdmin  
- **Geo-Fencing & Tracking:** Bluetooth-based technology  

## 🎯 How It Works
1. The lecturer generates a **unique QR code** for each lecture.
2. Students scan the QR code using their mobile devices.
3. Attendance is **marked only if the student is within the required 10m radius** of the lecturer’s device.
4. The data is securely stored and synced with the institution’s LMS.

## 💡 Why This Project?
We built this system to address the common issue of **proxy attendance** in colleges and universities. By leveraging **geo-fencing technology**, we ensure that students must be physically present to mark attendance, thus improving fairness and accuracy.
